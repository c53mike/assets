# The SPIFFE Asset Tracking Repository
This repository tracks all assets related to the SPIFFE/SPIRE projects. It serves to provide public transparency, guidance for those who need to make changes, and project continuity in the event of leadership or governance changes.

Each asset is given a subdirectory, in which a `README.md` describes their details, including ownership and access information, etc. It is the responsibility of the SPIFFE TSC to ensure that this information remains up-to-date.

## Adding a new asset
Any time that the SPIFFE/SPIRE projects pick up a new asset, it must be recorded in this repository as soon as possible. To do so, please create a new directory and copy `TEMPLATE.md` in, renaming it to `README.md`. Complete each field accordingly.

## Something is wrong or missing!
Please open an issue or PR against this repository to get it corrected.
